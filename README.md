Trajectory Optimization using PINNs
The files contians my work in trajecotry optimization using Physics informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Using the indirect method to get the equations of states and costates and the solving the Two-point Boundary value Problem (TVBP), the couple state and costate ODEs. These are inheratly complex to solve as the intial condtions of the costates are not known. But using PINNs these can be solved, without knowing the intial conditions as these problems have unique solution.
